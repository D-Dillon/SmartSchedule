>### Current version: V1.0
>#### Scroll down for installation details

<br/>

#### **What this software does:**

>1. Shows you the date & time
>2. Shows you the class period you are currently in
>3. Shows you the next class you will have
>4. Shows you how long until the next class

#### **What I plan to add:**
>1. A feature that tells you how long you have until your next break (nutrition, lunch, or end of day) *(curently in development)*
>2. Weekend compatibility so that it doesn't just say N/A *(done, will be added in next update)*
>3. Settings so that you can assign the names of classes instead of just the numbers *(will not be added in V1.1)*
>4. Fix for the Wednsday algorythm so that it displays propper data *(done, will be added in next update)*
